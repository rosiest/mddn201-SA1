		<h1 style="text-align:center">Internet Infrastructure</h1>
		<p  style="text-align:center">The internet consists of a tangible physical system so that 
			we are able to move information from one place to another. 
			Internet infrastructure is the physical aspects of how information 
			is communicated and can come in numerous forms. Sometimes, these physical things 
			aren’t visible to the human eye simply because they’re unnoticeable. 
			The internet is able to ship binary information through things such as wires, 
			cables, etc. However, all over Wellington, these can be in the forms of, 
			but not limited to, antennae, CCTV cameras, manhole covers and distribution boards.</p>

			 so quickly and so easily.”</em>- Vinton Cerf</p>

			<h1>Antenna</h1>
			<p>Antennae are typically found on higher platforms and are used to transmit or receive signals. 
				In this case, the antennae in the images below are used for internet infrastructure as this
				enables various wireless networking. In Wellington, I saw antennae mainly on top of buildings
				in the CBD area. </p>

			<h1>CCTV Cameras</h1>
			<p>CCTV (closed-circuit television) cameras are a type of security through the use of video
				surveillance. These cameras transmit signals to a specific place, usually monitors that
				are able to be viewed. These were typically found both outside and inside of Wellington 
				stores, highly likely to monitor possible misdemeanour.</p>

			<h1>Manhole Covers</h1>
			<p>Most people do not know this, but to provide more connections to networks, 
				a lot of physical forms of internet infrastructure can be located below us.
				These underground cables are used for the communication of data to and from
				different places, whether it’s local or international. Manhole covers are passages
				to these cables so that they are easily accessible if some things were to go wrong. </p>

			<h1>Distribution Board</h1>
			<p>Distribution boards divide electrical power into subsidiary circuits as part of
				 an electricity supply system to provide power for our internet systems. 
				 These are where the electrical supply is distributed from so that buildings 
				 and houses can have access to power. Distribution boards were mainly located
				outside of buildings in Wellington in lots of different forms.</p>
